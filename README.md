Skrrt is a React Native application designed to emulate the functionality of the popular ride-sharing service Uber.
It provides a user-friendly interface for users to request rides, view travel time and distance, and calculate associated costs.
The app incorporates various technologies and APIs to deliver a seamless and efficient experience to its users.

### Features 
* **Tailwind CSS:** Skrrt leverages Tailwind CSS for its styling, allowing for rapid development and easy customization of the app's user interface.
* **Google Distance Matrix API:** The app utilises the Google Distance Matrix API to calculate travel time and distance between the user's location and their destination. This information is crucial for estimating the cost of the ride accurately.
* **Directions Google API:** Skrrt integrates the Directions Google API to provide real-time navigation directions to the drivers. This feature ensures that drivers can efficiently navigate to the user's desired destination.
* **Google Places API:** By incorporating the Google Places API, Skrrt enables users to search for specific locations and addresses easily. This functionality enhances the convenience and accuracy of the ride request process.
* **Apple & Google Maps Integration:** Skrrt leverages the native mapping capabilities of iOS and Android devices by integrating with Apple Maps and Google Maps. This integration ensures optimal navigation experiences on both platforms.
* **React Native Navigation:** Skrrt utilises React Native Navigation to facilitate seamless navigation between screens within the app. This navigation library provides smooth transitions and efficient routing, enhancing the overall user experience.
* **React Native Elements:** Skrrt employs React Native Elements, a popular UI toolkit to elevate the app's design. With a wide range of pre-designed components and styles, React Native Elements enables the creation of visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces.
